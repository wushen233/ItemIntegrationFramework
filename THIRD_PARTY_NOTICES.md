# Third-Party Notices

## FallUI compatibility source

`ui/actionscript/fallui-patches` contains an ActionScript item card file
modified for ItemIntegrationFramework interoperability. IIF additions are
released as source, but underlying Fallout 4 and FallUI portions remain the
property of their respective authors and are not relicensed by the repository
MIT License. No FallUI fonts, icons, FLA projects, or compiled SWFs are
included.

## Prisma UI 2.0

`ui/prisma` contains IIF-authored editor pages that use the Prisma UI F4
bridge. The Prisma UI framework is not vendored. Obtain it from the
[official repository](https://github.com/PRISMA-USER-INTERFACE-FRAMEWORK/Prisma2.0),
where it is distributed under its own `LICENSE.md` terms.

`src/PrismaUI_F4_API.h` and `src/GUIEditor/PrismaUI_F4_API.h` are public modder
API headers distributed for copying into consumer projects.

## Xbyak

The `src/xbyak` directory contains Xbyak by MITSUNARI Shigeo. Xbyak is
distributed under the 3-Clause BSD License. Its original copyright and license
text are retained in `src/xbyak/COPYRIGHT`.

## CommonLibF4 and commonlib-shared

This project is built against
[Dear-Modding-FO4/commonlibf4](https://github.com/Dear-Modding-FO4/commonlibf4)
at commit `ca31eeb6c7353555973bc351c6733d6492f2c66e`. CommonLibF4's top-level
code is distributed under the MIT License.

at commit `f0b1670ee9caac2e349497f6f3c08a69633a8ea7`. `commonlib-shared` is
distributed under GPL-3.0 with a Modding Exception. The exception permits
Modded Code to link with `commonlib-shared` without causing that Modded Code to
be covered by the GPL. Project-authored source in this repository therefore
